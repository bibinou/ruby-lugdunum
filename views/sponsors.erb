<h3 id="officialfm"><a href="">Official.fm</a></h3>
<div class="summary">
  <p>Official.fm provide state-of-the-art services for audio professionals to help them optimize the day2day management of their audio files.</p>
<p>Hosting, Distribution, Promotion, Statistics, Selling, Licensing, Tour Organization and connecting with fans are some examples of our existing and/or upcoming services.</p>
<p>Launched in August 2010 from Geneva, Switzerland, our company has raised in excess of $8M USD.</p>

<p>Led by CEO Jeremie Abihssira and backed by a group of powerful investors , Official.fm acquired the code and the database from the now defunct Fairtilizer.com and has aggressively built out the platform. Key employees from Fairtilizer.com such as Antoine Marguerie, Amaechi Uzoigwe, Jerome Mestre and Ben Colon were also retained. </p>

<p>Official.fm team, composed of 18 talented/passionate/experienced people, is the perfect equation between 3 worlds: Tech, Music and Finance.</p>

<p>Our goal:  To become the "basecamp" for audio professionals.</p>

<p>We strongly think that a huge amount of needs coming from Artists, Labels or promotion agencies remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Just talk randomly with an artist, a label or a marketing company and you''ll see there's an ocean of opportunities to improve the existing scope of online services for audio pros.</p>

<p>Each step of the way, we will do our best to offer "straight forward" and "user-friendly" features, allowing them to spend less time on their computer and more time on their core activity.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we are working on re-defining the way content owners interact with their fans. Even if it's not all about selling music anymore, at the end of the day, fans are not only an artist's most viable consumer but also their best promoters.</p>
