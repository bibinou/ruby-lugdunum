 Designing a network application: from TCPServer to Goliath
      </h5>
      <span class="summary">
        <p>
In this talk, we will look at the problem of handling concurrent requests in Ruby web servers. After a reharsal on network (TCP) programming, we will discuss two orthogonal problems in web servers: having a friendly APIs and managing concurrent access. Given this problem space, we will then navigate along the path of Ruby webservers' implementation. We will finish with Goliath, the more advanced solution.
After the talk, attendees should have a comprehensive picture of networked application's design. They should be able to tell what to change in their code to make it more efficient.

Goliath est un framework Ruby basé sur EventMachine, qui utilise l'API de Rack et tire parti des fibres de Ruby 1.9. Cela en fait un framework léger, capable d'offrir d'excellentes performances et de traiter de manières asynchrones de nombreuses entrées/sorties, le tout de manière très élégante. Il convient donc très bien pour écrire des petits services web : uploads de fichiers en streaming HTTP, firehose à la Twitter, proxy divers et variés...

Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the concepts of component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails, proving that there should be no such thing as a double-render error, and that one need not be slave to the great monolithic view mentality. Also, he would like to have beer with you.

CRUD is not REST! Hypermedia for y'all!

      <span class="summary">
        <p>
REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However, many implementations forget about the distributed part of REST and simply map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application. Hey, we want more! So let's have a look at the Roar gem and see how it helps working with representations, hypermedia, and decoupled architectures in Rails and Sinatra. While building both services and a consuming client we can discuss the sweet things about component-oriented architectures and french beer.

Ruby goes to Hollywood
      </h5>
      <span class="summary">
        <p>
Computers are being built with more and more CPUs and those CPUs in turn have several cores. Powerful calculations are now performed either on many-cored machines, or on distributed systems.
In this context, it's in the developer's interest to start thinking about concurrent programming. But concurrent programming with mutable is tricky. The last few years have conclusively shown that very few developers get this right when faced with conventional shared state threads.
        </p>
        <p>
One of the ways to simplify concurrent programming is the actor model.
In the actor model, programs are made of actors sending each other messages, and acting on the messages they receive. The actors don't share any state.
        </p>
        <p>
In this talk I explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>
The existing actor implementations in Ruby:
- Rubinius actors
- existing actor gems (cross Ruby implementations)
Actor implementations that are a little more 'out there':
- bindings with the Akka framework in Scala with JRuby
- bindings with erlang, the first mainstream implementation of the actor model
And their advantages and drawbacks, and code examples.
        </p>
        <p>
The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).

Real Time Rack

        <p>
At least since node.js everyone knows that real time HTTP responses are the next big thing. The secrets of handling incoming requests asynchronously with Ruby is not yet far spread among Rubyists, as the internals needed for such responses are neither specified nor documented and there is a lack of tools. Still, it is possible to use Server-Sent Events,  Websockets and akin with Rack today. This talk will demonstrate the underlying technologies and how to use them.

Why do some people keep talking about diversity? Who cares if we're all the same? So long as we're not technically discriminating against anyone, that means we're good, right? If we only get applications from white dudes, that must mean that white dudes are the only ones out there. Right? Right?

When we feel threatened, we find comfort among people who seem most like us. As specialization increases in the community, we glom on to people who look like us, talk like us, and think like us. There's safety in a crowd.

But there are real dangers in becoming too much alike: monotony breeds more monotony. Real innovation happens when you think different than everyone else. What happens when we ruthlessly eliminate different thinkers, as we winnow the stack of resumés to those that seem most likely to "fit in"?

Come to this talk to find out what you can do to diversify - yourself, your organization, and your peers - and how you can help grow a better, stronger, more diverse community.

The Limited Red Society

During an hour of programming what do you learn about your performance? How did that last refactoring go? How does that hour compare to the previous hour? How about against last week or last month? How are your habits as a programmer improving? How does your refactoring pattern differ from a masters like Martin Fowlers?
<p></p>
Professional Tennis players learn from detailed statistics about how they performed in a game and use this information to become better players.
<p></p>
Why don't we do the same in Programming? I want to demonstrate how we can, especially how we as individual programmers can help limit the time we spend in the red (failing tests) while developing. How long we spend in the red and how often can reflect on how we are working as programmers. Joshua Kerievsky created "The Limited Red Society", a group of practitioners that have learned how to effectively reduce red time while test-driving and refactoring code. I want to introduce this society to the Ruby world and some of the tools and ideas I have been working on.
<p></p>
We can gain detailed insight into your programming patterns while using a TDD flow by recording the state of your tests every time you run them. From these detailed metrics we can start to visualise how you work. How long did we spend in the red with that failed test? Was that test we wrote too big a step leaving us stuck in the red for too long? Did we spend a long time in the red because we were shaving a Yak? How many unit tests did we just break with that last change?
